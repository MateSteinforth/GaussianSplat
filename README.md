[Substance 3D Viewer (Beta)](https://helpx.adobe.com/de/substance-3d-viewer.html) from Adobe lets you create Gaussian Splats with a pretty good text-to-3D model. Unfortunately Adobe had to do their own thing (ofc) so the .PLY file is not compatible with most viewers/editors. This is a quick converter that you can easily run directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13y6C3kVZpaeUSXzXjRiY-rZTg39qS9uo?usp=sharing) to convert your files.

Subtance 3D Viewer does not let you officially export the files, but it tells you where it keeps the temp files. Just load this into the converter and voila.
